.SH NAME
pkgfmt \- format a package manifest
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/usr/bin/pkgfmt [-c|-d|-s|-u] [\fIpackage-manifest-file\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgfmt\fR without the \fB-c\fR or \fB-d\fR options formats a package manifest in a consistent manner, including wrapping lines at 80 characters, sorting actions by type, and sorting attributes. Lines that do not parse into actions (such as macros, comments, or transforms) do not appear in sorted order.
.sp
.LP
If no arguments are given, \fBpkgfmt\fR reads \fBstdin\fR until EOF, and then writes the formatted manifest to \fBstdout\fR. Any manifests specified on the command line are formatted in place.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgfmt\fR with the \fB-c\fR option checks whether the manifests are formatted in \fBpkgfmt\fR style. The \fB-d\fR option displays the differences if the file is not properly formatted.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgfmr\fR with the \fB-s\fR option removes additional diagnostic attributes from actions that are not required in a published manifest.
