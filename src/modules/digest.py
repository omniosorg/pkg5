# pkg(5) uses cryptographic hash functions for a number of tasks. We define the
# default hash function, along with the hash name here. Note that the use of
# hashes in package metadata is *not* governed by this value, since multiple
# hashes are supported for payload-bearing actions in a package.
#
# Some uses of hashes are image-format specific, and may require image version
# increments, in which case the required algorithm is hardcoded where it is
# used, along with with an appropriate comment.
#
# Other uses are essentially volatile, and the hash used has no persistence
# (e.g. saving the hash to a file in a temporary directory, when the hash gets
# regenerated on service restart). For those volatile uses, DEFAULT_HASH_FUNC is
# recommended.

# DEFAULT_XXX_ATTRS are the attributes added to actions by the packaging system
# at publication time.
#
# Notably, the hashes we add to an action at publication *do not* need to
# correspond to the hashes we may use to verify action payload during install or
# update, allowing an upgrade path where we could choose to drop publication
# support for a certain hash algorithm, but still retain the ability to install
# actions using that hash.
#
# The order of these lists of attributes is significant only to the
# extent that the repository code will store the file in the repository using
# the first hash value in the list when using the *old* publication model (ie.
# a transaction, with multiple add_file(..) methods to add content)
#
# Otherwise, when publishing, we always store files in the repository
# using the "least preferred" hash for maximum backwards compatibility with
# older packaging tools that expect to be able to find those hashes in the
# repository, but do add additional hashes to the action metadata.
#
# When using the transport to download content from a repository, we use the
# least preferred_hash for file retrieval, but verify the installed content
# using the "most preferred" hash. See get_preferred_hash(..),
# get_least_preferred_hash(..) and get_common_preferred_hash(..)
